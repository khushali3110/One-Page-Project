HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
        I use HTML as the foundation for creating web pages, structuring content with tags like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
        I'm skilled in semantic HTML, which helps improve accessibility and SEO, ensuring that web content is well-organized and easily understood by both users and search engines.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
        CSS allows me to style and layout web pages, from setting colors and fonts to controlling the overall design and spacing.
        I am proficient in different CSS techniques, including Flexbox and Grid for layout, as well as responsive design through media queries to ensure that pages look great on all devices.
        I also work with various types of CSS (inline, internal, and external) to keep my code organized and efficient.

Bootstrap
        I have experience using Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, to create responsive and mobile-first web pages quickly and efficiently.
        I utilize Bootstrap's grid system and pre-built components to streamline the design process, making it easier to achieve a polished and professional look.

JavaScript
        I am currently learning JavaScript to add interactivity to web pages, enabling dynamic content updates, form validations, and interactive elements.
        I am familiar with JavaScript basics, including variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements, which help make websites more engaging and responsive to user input.

Python
        I have a foundational understanding of Python, which I've used for problem-solving and scripting tasks.
        Python's simplicity and versatility make it useful for both backend web development and general programming tasks, such as automating processes and working with data.

C++
        With C++, I have gained experience in object-oriented programming and have built a strong understanding of core programming concepts like data structures, algorithms, and memory management.
        My knowledge of C++ strengthens my programming foundation, helping me tackle complex problems efficiently and optimize performance.

Responsive Layout:
         Implemented a flexible grid system using CSS to ensure the layout adjusts seamlessly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
         Used CSS media queries to enhance the responsiveness of the design, allowing for different card arrangements and font sizes based on screen width.

Card Design:
         Created individual movie/show cards using HTML and CSS, featuring a poster image, title, genre, and rating.
         Incorporated hover effects with CSS to improve user interaction, such as scaling the cards and changing the opacity of images when hovered over, making the interface more dynamic.

Styling and Theme:
         Utilized a dark color scheme consistent with Netflix's branding, applying background colors, gradients, and shadows to enhance visual appeal.
         Chose modern, legible typography for titles and descriptions to maintain readability and match the aesthetic of popular streaming services.

Navigation Bar:
         Designed a sticky navigation bar at the top of the page for easy access to different sections, such as Home, My List, and Categories.
         Styled the navigation links using CSS for hover effects and transitions, creating a smooth user experience.

Grid and Flexbox Layouts:
         Employed CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a structured layout for displaying movie cards in rows and columns, ensuring efficient use of space and alignment.
         Ensured that card elements adjusted dynamically within the grid for a cohesive and organized look.

Additional Features:
         Implemented a search bar to simulate functionality for users to search for specific titles (even if it's static for the project).
        Used CSS animations for subtle transitions, such as fading in elements when the page loads or when the user hovers over cards.
